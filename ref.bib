	abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques provide us with unique views on brain structure and function; i.e., how the brain is wired, and where and when activity takes place. Data acquired using these techniques can be analyzed in terms of its network structure to reveal organizing principles at the systems level. Graph representations are versatile models where nodes are associated to brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections. Structural graphs model neural pathways in white matter, which are the anatomical backbone between regions. Functional graphs are built based on functional connectivity, which is a pairwise measure of statistical interdependency between pairs of regional activity traces. Therefore, most research to date has focused on analyzing these graphs reflecting structure or function. Graph signal processing ({GSP}) is an emerging area of research where signals recorded at the nodes of the graph are studied atop the underlying graph structure. An increasing number of fundamental operations have been generalized to the graph setting, allowing to analyze the signals from a new viewpoint. Here, we review {GSP} for brain imaging data and discuss their potential to integrate brain structure, contained in the graph itself, with brain function, residing in the graph signals. We review how brain activity can be meaningfully filtered based on concepts of spectral modes derived from brain structure. We also derive other operations such as surrogate data generation or decompositions informed by cognitive systems. In sum, {GSP} offers a novel framework for the analysis of brain imaging data.},

	abstract = {Cognitive flexibility describes the human ability to switch between modes of mental function to achieve goals. Mental switching is accompanied by transient changes in brain activity, which must occur atop an anatomical architecture that bridges disparate cortical and subcortical regions by underlying white matter tracts. However, an integrated perspective regarding how white matter networks might constrain brain dynamics during cognitive processes requiring flexibility has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we applied emerging tools from graph signal processing to examine whether {BOLD} signals measured at each point in time correspond to complex underlying anatomical networks in 28 individuals performing a perceptual task that probed cognitive flexibility. We found that the alignment between functional signals and the architecture of the underlying white matter network was associated with greater cognitive flexibility across subjects. By computing a concise measure using multi-modal neuroimaging data, we uncovered an integrated structure-function correlate of human behavior.},

	abstract = {Vision science, particularly machine vision, has been revolutionized by introducing large-scale image datasets and statistical learning approaches. Yet, human neuroimaging studies of visual perception still rely on small numbers of images (around 100) due to time-constrained experimental procedures. To apply statistical learning approaches that integrate neuroscience, the number of images used in neuroimaging must be significantly increased. We present {BOLD}5000, a human functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) study that includes almost 5,000 distinct images depicting real-world scenes. Beyond dramatically increasing image dataset size relative to prior {fMRI} studies, {BOLD}5000 also accounts for image diversity, overlapping with standard computer vision datasets by incorporating images from the Scene {UNderstanding} ({SUN}), Common Objects in Context ({COCO}), and {ImageNet} datasets. The scale and diversity of these image datasets, combined with a slow event-related {fMRI} design, enable fine-grained exploration into the neural representation of a wide range of visual features, categories, and semantics. Concurrently, {BOLD}5000 brings us closer to realizing Marr's dream of a singular vision science - the intertwined study of biological and computer vision.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of network data is leading to a growing interest in processing of signals on graphs. One notable tool for extending conventional signal-processing operations to networks is the graph Fourier transform that can be obtained as the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. In this letter, we used the graph Fourier transform to deﬁne a new method for generating surrogate graph signals. The approach is based on signrandomization of the graph Fourier coefﬁcients and, therefore, the correlation structure of the surrogate graph signals (i.e., smoothness on the graph topology) is imposed by the measured data. The proposed method of surrogate data generation can be widely applied for nonparametric statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we showed a proof-of-concept with a high-density electroencephalography dataset.},
